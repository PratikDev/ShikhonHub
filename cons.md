# Cons

1. Extra learning curve for both the Institution and teachers, as well as the students.
2. Institutions with low budget may not be able to afford the technology. But it can be solved by providing customized pricing plans.
3. We have to collect many student data, which might be a privacy concern. (data-dumping)
4. An over-reliance on AI tools may lead to a decline in quality and richness of educational content, with the risk of perpetuating inaccuracies or biases present in the training data of the AI models.
